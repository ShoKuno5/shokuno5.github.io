# About me

I work at the intersection of research and engineering, building creative systems with machine learning. My everyday tools include probabilistic models, geometric deep learning, and quick sketches that explain how the pieces attach.

## What I'm exploring

- Generative models for creative applications
- Optimization techniques that make training actually finish
- Interfaces that help humans collaborate with their models

## Why this feed exists

The post stream doubles as my lab notebook. Ideas, demos, and formal writing show up together so you can see how one informs the next.

## Reach out

Collaborations, critiques, and wild hypotheses are all welcome. You can reach me at [kunosho1225@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp](mailto:kunosho1225@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp) or find a more personal note in the tagged posts.
