**CAUTION!**
A bunch of scraps below...

---

Dear Mr. Kobo Abe, I am down to solve the question you posed to us readers and provided no valuable quantitative study in your lifetime, by the language that belongs to machines.

---

- Would solving my questions yield answers to my existential questions?

Living days idly as in the logs will not enhance the chance of my salvation.

- A list of ideas that pop into my mind on the means of exploiting my time are:
  - meet some of my old friends and reach a conclusion.
  - reproduce my personal moments with migraine, nausea, carte and such.
  - would considering the data aid in understanding the mechanism of learning?
  - would it be possible to retain all the logs about the world just from a series of logs of sounds and vision, perhaps text?
  - When a baby calls an entity its mother for the first time in its life, how is the naming/name-matching process explainable?
  - Lies, fakeness, persona, disguise, patches, collage. 
  - deception
  - Recollecting my words

A man would decieve himself by replacing his thoguhts prcoess by a machinery part. We won't get fooled again but the age explains everything as much as it does not. Stay gold inside. After all, what is so overwhelming? Thinking about life as if the sky Gaia puts on her shoudler? 

Every thought process is now supervised by the big brother, and I easily fall into to existential crisis.

Is consumption without money definable? 

Who would read the scraps in this era?

I am down to make a new media. 


## Ape, Inc
### Plan for Primal Times

- We live and grow like hermit crabs do; we are to find a better shelter that would fit ourselves.
  - We live and grow like apes, crafting all recognized entities by our hand. 
- But what distinguishes us humans from other species is that we have memory, text, and the cognitive system for structures. 
  - We thus create incremental, internal, recursive patterns of wall systems to better hide our raw bodies and avoid exposure to the exterior.
- We are one step behind cyborgs, one step away from apes.
- If not written, not exist.

# Naive Hope
## The Second Birth of Early Human

Since the moment we observed the auto-reproduction of the Tower of Babel that we built while we ascended, and became convinced that we would never see the other end of its fate, we decided to descend. 

On the ground, we would find the locals, animals, and nature—things we had never been able to understand so well until then, by virtue of the loss of words. 

## Questions that Comprise One's Self

The question that triggers me the most is: 

*Does a generative model (I see it as the second being) understand the structure of what it generates?*

A series of questions awaits a series of answers before I can tackle the above question. For example, 

- *What does it mean to generate?*
- *What is the second being and what is not?*
- *Why do we care about the structure?*

I am yet to discover the methods to answer the primal question. 

A few words that would describe the area of my research are: 

*Geometric Deep Learning, Structure Learning, Generative Models*

The examples of the data format I deal with every day are: 

*Graph, Image, text*

My research sounds vague, broad and obscure. 
But my question, essentially, is about the obscure.

## Notes

**2025/09/25**
- One day after nausea and migraine, I could stay up to open a book on Dub, then the words would be untangled and coiled up, and so I chose to close a book right away. 
- 

**2025/09/23**
- Vitamin is always what we miss. That is why we get disappointed when we find out the root cause of our depression. 

**2025/09/13**
- There is nothing happier than receiving money for the mathematics I do. 
- All the assumption I had made to build a self image were to be discarded before the entry of the tower. 

**2025/09/11**
- The definition of one's intelligence is the ability to cognize and localize one's self in the embedding context and act on the persona. 
- For sure, I will only be resituated in the world reflecting my position in the stream of society, however implicitly.
