### Welcome to the web

Every page here is a post—research fragments, project notes, personal updates, and even this self-introduction. Scroll the home feed to move through my work chronologically, or tap the filter chips to quickly pivot by tag. The All Posts and Tags hubs sit at the end of the feed once you're ready to dive deeper.

### How to explore

- The newest pieces sit at the top of the stream.
- Each post lists its tags; selecting one filters the feed and highlights related writing.
- The *All posts* card collects everything in a simple list if you prefer scanning titles.
- The *Tags* card reveals the full tag graph with counts.
