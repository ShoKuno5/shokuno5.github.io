# Greetings
Welcome to my page! I made this website to maintain (or retain) my habit of writing.

This page serves as the home page as well as a timeline view of all of my published posts.
I talk about machine learning and associated mathematical concepts here:
[my research page](/research).

You'll notice that each post has a comment function where you can start or join a conversation. Feel free to open the
post and leave a remark!

# About Me

Hello, I am a machine learning enthusiast based in Tokyo, working on research in the field of mathematical informatics and engineering. 

My current interests lie in basically anything that has to do with structure and learning. To list more specific fields of research, 
- Symmetry in generative models such as Flow and Diffusion models
- Geometric Deep Learning, typically for non-Euclidean Data (i.e. Graphs)
- Applications such as Computer Vision, and more recently, formal proofs by machinery and blockchain.

My past research works include:
- (Master's thesis) Generative Modeling of Graph-Structured Data via Latent Flow Matching
- (Industry Internship) Graph-Based Approaches on Anime Frame Interpolation
- (Bachelor's thesis) Time-series prediction of a dynamical system via Reservoir Computing

You'll find more organized profiles in the following links.
