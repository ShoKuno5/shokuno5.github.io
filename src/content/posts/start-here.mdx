Welcome to my page! I made this website to maintain (or retain) my habit of writing.\

This page serves as the home page as well as a timeline view of all of my published posts. 
I talk about machine learning and associated mathematical concepts here.

Each post has a comment function where you can start or join a conversation. Feel free to open the post and leave a remark!
