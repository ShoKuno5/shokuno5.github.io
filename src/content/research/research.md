# Questions that Comprise One's Self

The question that triggers me the most is: 

*Does a generative model (I see it as the second being) understand the structure of what it generates?*

A series of questions awaits a series of answers before I can tackle the above question. For example, 

- *What does it mean to generate?*
- *What is the second being and what is not?*
- *Why do we care about the structure?*

I am yet to discover the methods to answer the primal question. 

A few words that would describe the area of my research are: 

*Geometric Deep Learning, Structure Learning, Generative Models*

The examples of the data format I deal with every day are: 

*Graph, Image, text*

My research sounds vague, broad and obscure. 
But my question, essentially, is about the obscure.
