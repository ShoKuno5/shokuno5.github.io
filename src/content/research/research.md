# Naive Hope
## The Second Birth of Early Human

Since the moment we observed the auto-reproduction of the Tower of Babel that we built while we ascended, and became convinced that we would never see the other end of its fate, we decided to descend. 

On the ground, we would find the locals, animals, and natureâ€”things we had never been able to understand so well until then, by virture of the loss of words. 


# Questions that Comprise One's Self

The question that triggers me the most is: 

*Does a generative model (I see it as the second being) understand the structure of what it generates?*

A series of questions awaits a series of answers before I can tackle the above question. For example, 

- *What does it mean to generate?*
- *What is the second being and what is not?*
- *Why do we care about the structure?*

I am yet to discover the methods to answer the primal question. 

A few words that would describe the area of my research are: 

*Geometric Deep Learning, Structure Learning, Generative Models*

The examples of the data format I deal with every day are: 

*Graph, Image, text*

My research sounds vague, broad and obscure. 
But my question, essentially, is about the obscure.

# Notes
## 2025
### September 2025

**2025/09/13**
- There is nothing happier than receiving money for the mathematics I do. 
- All the assumption I had made to build a self image were to be discarded before the entry of the tower. 

**2025/09/11**
- The definition of one's intelligence is the ability to cognize and localize one's self in the embedding context and act on the persona. 
- For sure, I will only be resituated in the world reflecting my position in the stream of society, however implicitly.
