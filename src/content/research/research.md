My research explores the generation of discrete objects and the morphing of structures through the lens of machine learning. I focus on three interconnected areas that form the foundation of modern AI systems capable of understanding and creating complex patterns.

**Key areas:** Geometric Generative Models (Diffusion Model, Flow Matching), Graph Neural Networks

## Geometric Deep Learning

Investigating how neural networks can learn from non-Euclidean domains, including graphs, manifolds, and point clouds. This approach enables AI systems to understand and process data with inherent geometric structure.

## Generative Models

Developing algorithms that can create new, meaningful instances of data. My work explores how these models can generate discrete objects while maintaining structural coherence and semantic meaning.

## Graph Neural Networks

Studying how neural architectures can process graph-structured data, enabling applications in molecular design, social network analysis, and knowledge representation.

Beyond my technical research, I dedicate time to creative writingâ€”exploring existential questions through prose and revisiting the philosophical landscapes that shape our understanding of consciousness and being.
